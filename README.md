# Project Suggestion: A Simple Task Management Application

This project involves creating a basic task management application with features for creating, assigning, updating, and deleting tasks. It will cover key aspects of backend development (API creation, database interaction) and frontend development (UI rendering, state management).

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create a new project directory.
    *   Initialize the project with necessary configuration files (e.g., package.json, pom.xml).

2.  **Backend Development:**
    *   **API Endpoints:**
        *   Implement RESTful API endpoints for task management:
            *   `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
                *   Request body: Task details (title, description, status, assigned user).
                *   Response: Created task object.
            *   `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
                *   Response: List of task objects.
            *   `GET /tasks/{id}`: Retrieve a task by ID.
                *   Response: Task object.
            *   `PUT /tasks/{id}`: Update a task.
                *   Request body: Updated task details.
                *   Response: Updated task object.
            *   `DELETE /tasks/{id}`: Delete a task.
                *   Response: Success/failure status.
    *   **Data Model:**
        *   Define a data model for tasks with the following attributes:
            *   ID (unique identifier)
            *   Name
            *   Description
            *   Status (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Completed")
            *   Assigned User
    *   **Data Persistence:**
        *   Implement data persistence using a database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2).
        *   Use an ORM or data access library to interact with the database.
    *   **Middleware/Interceptors:**
        *   Implement middleware or interceptors for:
            *   Logging: Log all incoming requests and outgoing responses.
            *   Error Handling: Handle exceptions and return appropriate error responses.
    *   **Validation:**
        *   Implement request body validation to ensure that the data received from the client is valid.

3.  **Frontend Development:**
    *   **UI Components:**
        *   Create reusable UI components for:
            *   Task List: Displays a list of tasks.
            *   Task Details: Displays details of a single task.
            *   Task Form: A form for creating and updating tasks.
    *   **State Management:**
        *   Use a state management library or React Context to manage application state.
    *   **API Integration:**
        *   Fetch data from the backend APIs using `fetch` or Axios.
    *   **Routing:**
        *   Implement client-side routing for different views (e.g., task list, task details).
    *   **Forms:**
        *   Create forms for creating and updating tasks.

4.  **General Requirements:**
    *   **Authentication:**
        *   Implement basic authentication to protect the API endpoints.
    *   **Authorization:**
        *   Implement role-based authorization to restrict access to certain features.
    *   **Testing:**
        *   Write unit tests and integration tests for backend and frontend components.
    *   **Deployment:**
        *   Prepare the application for deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Netlify).
    *   **Version Control:**
        *   Use Git for version control and collaboration.

5.  **UI Wireframe:**

The UI should consist of the following views:

1.  **Task List View:**
    *   A table or list displaying all tasks.
    *   Columns: Title, Status, Assigned User, Due Date (optional).
    *   Buttons:
        *   "Add Task": Navigates to the Task Form view.
        *   "View Details": Navigates to the Task Details view for a specific task.
    *   Filtering/Sorting:
        *   Options to filter tasks by status or assigned user.
        *   Options to sort tasks by due date or priority.

2.  **Task Details View:**
    *   Displays all details of a selected task.
    *   Fields: Title, Description, Status, Assigned User, Due Date (optional), Created Date, Updated Date.
    *   Buttons:
        *   "Edit Task": Navigates to the Task Form view with pre-filled data for the selected task.
        *   "Delete Task": Deletes the task (with confirmation).
        *   "Back to List": Navigates back to the Task List view.

3.  **Task Form View:**
    *   A form for creating new tasks or updating existing tasks.
    *   Fields:
        *   Title (text input)
        *   Description (textarea)
        *   Status (dropdown/select)
        *   Assigned User (text input or dropdown/select)
        *   Due Date (date picker - optional)
    *   Buttons:
        *   "Save": Creates or updates the task.
        *   "Cancel": Navigates back to the Task List view.
